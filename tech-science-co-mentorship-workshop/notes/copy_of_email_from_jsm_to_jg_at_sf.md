> Hi [J], thanks again for the really fun conversation last week! The resources you shared were incredibly helpful!
> 
> Below are some follow ups from our conversation:

> Freemocap Materials -
> 
> As requested, I'm attaching an 'executive summary' document that outlines the basic mission of the FreeMoCap project. This was the front page of the Epic MegaGrant we submitted in January, so it's slightly out of date (esp the roadmap on page 2) but the general vibe of the text on page 1 is still aligned with our current work.
> 
> That write up was paired with this short video that provides a demo of an animation made with the freemocap software (specifically made by someone  with little-to-no animation experience, aka myself ðŸ˜…) - https://youtu.be/WW_WpMcbzns
> 
> I hope you enjoy the materials, and please let me know if you have any questions!

> 
> Tech/Science Co-Mentorship Workshop -
> 
> In our conversation, we also briefly discussed an interesting science/tech opportunity that was arising from my work developing the software side of freemocap.
> 
> Basically, my friend and CTO [EI] (who has 10+ years XP as a software engineer) has been helping me get the software up to 'professional standards' and set it up with the infrastructure needed to be a widely used and well-supported open source project.
> 
> I was describing to some other scientist friends how incredibly powerful and useful this mentorship/training had been for my research activities, and they almost universally expressed interest in getting that kind of assistance with the software side of their labs. In addition Endurance shared how much fun he was having working on the 'interesting' problems this kind of scientific software touched on, and said that he had a number of tech friends who would be interested in working with scientific labs. To that end, we wound up connecting one of Endurance's friends (Reyes Salinas) with Sangbae Kim's robotics lab at MIT, and it's been a very fruitful pairing so far.
> 
> After we talked last week, I was brainstorming ways that we could facilitate more of this kind of Tech/Science pairing, and one possibility would be to host a (small scale, pilot test) workshop/bootcamp kind of meeting in Winter '22 or Summer '23. Basically, we could bring 3-4 labs to spend ~3-5 days working to learn "best practices" for scientific software development and open source/science practices (e.g. Git-based version control, continuous integration, automated testing, etc).
> 
> The focus would be to provide 'pairing' and 'mentor' style instruction, where the tech folks would assist the science folks in adapting their existing code bases into a more sustainable and extensible format, while the science folks introduce the tech folks to the research questions that drive their software development and needs.
> 
> The idea would be to teach the science folks methods for better software development that they can then disseminate back to their labs when they leave the workshop (i.e. more senior, tech-savvy lab members can teach junior lab members). This would also be an opportunity to forge connections between the tech people and the different science labs, so that the tech people can have the opportunity to contribute to the ongoing work of those research labs and the science people have someone to call on for help with the software side of their research.
> 
> If [S] could help fund an initial 'pilot test' workshop, we can use that opportunity to develop a more general curriculum that we can disseminate in the freely accessible educational materials, which will in turn form the basis of future (larger scale) meetings.
> 
> In general - Does this sound like the kind of thing that [S] would like to support? If so, let me know and I will put together a more detailed  and offivcial 'Letter of Intent" that includes cost estimates, potential curricula, planned outcomes and deliverables, etc.

> Thanks again for your help so far, I look forward to chatting more on these topics the future - Have a great weekend!
