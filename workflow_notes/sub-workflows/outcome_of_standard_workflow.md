# Outcome of Standard Workflow
 
 A `session_folder` named `session_id` located at `[system_user_folder]/freemocap_data/[session_id]` that contains:
- `calibration_data`(folder)
	- NOTE - maybe this should be kept separate from the `[session_folder]`?
	- `calibration_videos` (folder)
		- Contains synchronized videos from [calibrate_capture_volume](calibrate_capture_volume.md)
		- maybe subfolders with `raw` videos and `annotated` videos?
	- `[session_id]_camera_calibration.toml`
		- camera/capture volume calibration data from `anipose` calculation
	- `charuco_2d` - 
		- `npy` and `csv` files containing `charuco` data from each recordings
	- `logs`
		- Log files containing output from `anipose` calibration process
- `synchronized_videos`(folder)
	- synchronized videos from each camera
		- videos are 'frame perfect,' i.e. they have precisely the same number of frames, and each frame is synchronized so that (say) frame#153 from Camera0 corresponds to the same moment in time as frame#153 from Camera2
			- For now, let's say they are 'synchronized' if the are less than 1 `frame_duration` apart (so for 30fps videos, frame should be +/- 33ms)
	- timestamp data from each camera
		- in `npy` format
		- in `csv` format (via `pandas.DataFrame.to_csv`)
- `annotated_videos`(folder)
	- same as `synchronized_videos`, except:
		- the videos have the `mediapipe_2d` data drawn on top of it (i.e. draw skeletons on the people)
		- Maybe also draw `charuco` data?
		- No timestamp data
- `output_data` (folder)
	- `Medipipe_2d` data
		- as `npy` and `csv` and `pickle` (pickle contains all the `mediapipe_results` objects?)
	- `Mediapipe_3d` data
		- as `npy`
			- `body`, `right_hand`, `left_hand`, `face` data saved separately
			- 3d XYZ data  AND 'reprojection error' data (same structure)
		- as `csv`
			- via `pandas.DataFrame.to_csv`
	- `[session_id].blend` Blender file
	- Any other optional outputs (see [open_in_blender](open_in_blender.md))
