# Set Up Physical Cameras
- Attach webcams to your computer
    - Preferably, directly into a USB port
    - USB Hubs are less reliable. Sometimes you can get 2 cameras running through a single hub, but often the camera feed will die. 
- Come up with a plan to mount your cameras to point at your desired `capture volume`
    - **Capture Volume** - the 3D space in which there is sufficient camera coverage to support tracking the subject in 3d. Typically, an area where there are overlapping fields of view from at least 2 (preferably 3) cameras
    - The simplest method is to orient the cameras so that you maximize the overlap of their fields of view on top of the area you are trying to capture
    - I have had the best luck using 3-5 cameras
    - In theory, we could cover larger spaces using larger numbers of cameras, but I have less experience with that
