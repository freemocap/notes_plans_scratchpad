# Open in Blender
- Somehow get the path to an installation of `Blender` on the User's computer
	- Either installed via `chocolatey`, or
	- Maybe give user the ability to select their own `Blender.exe` path?
		- Blender has a lot of versions, and they aren't always compatible with each other
		
- Use `mediapipe_3D` data to drive a `Rigify` rig
	- like a much more better version of the process in `alpha_freemocap_blender_megascript.py`
- Save out `[session_id].blend`
- Button to open that `.blend` file in Blender
- Maybe - 
	- Option to auto-export as `fbx`, `csv`, `bvh`, etc, using Blender's export functionaltiy
		- So basically - we put our raw data into Blender and then ask Blender to export as those various formats
