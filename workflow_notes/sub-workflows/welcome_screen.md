# Welcome Screen

- **A screen pops up that says 'Welcome to FreeMoCap' and there is a picture of Skelly**
	- Let's say there are a number of buttons each representing a potential workflow, e.g.:
		- First FreeMoCap Session
		- Calibrate Capture Volume
		- Record new motion capture session
		- Reprocess previous motion capture session
		- Load external videos (e.g. GoPro's)
		- Post process or view previous motion capture session
	- Select "First FreeMoCap Session"
