freemocap things: 
## need to update a dependency in pre-alpha
- `mediapipe` needs to be updated to a new version for the `pre-alpha` code to run
- how update pypi, given that we `froze` that version and removed it from the repo
- **I'm considering moving the `freemocap` folder back into the repo so we can release a new version that fixes that dependency issue**
    - this will also let me add some new QoL changes to the workflow that will help people in the community make progress as the new `alpha` code solidifies    
   

## ReadMe not accurate, which is causing trouble for new comers 
 - need update with instructions on how to run GUI
 - Need better direction to `pre-alpha` instructions
 
 ## The GUI is still not quite functional/stable as I want it to be
 - still can be crashy sometimes
 - not sure it scales to more than ~3 cameras
 - Very slow relative to the `pre-alpha`? 
     - `triangulate3d` methods like 10x slower in GUI than in pre-alpha?
         - in terms of the `items/sec` metric
     - Maybe due to `numba` paralellization not working properly with QT?
     
 ## GUI will need a major refactor soon
 - I feel like I'm starting to bonk into the limitations of the architectural slop I laid out in the initial build
     - the whole thing has a strong "I learned this by making it" vibe
 - One of the main 'bonk' points now comes when I'm trying to set things up to 'remember' the user's selections from the previous run through
     - I keep thinking about the thing you showed me from your job, where the app was run with a big `json`/`dict` thing under the hood that kept track of the app state
     - I want to refactor with the app state explicity structured and defined in terms of that kind of heirarchical data structure
 
 ## Should we/I step back from the GUI for a bit and focus on building a simple CLI to run the main pipeline? 
 - Basically, recreate the command-line based methods of the pre-alpha, but using better practices for building CLIs
 - Might be a waste of time, but might also make a quicker in-road towards having a 'functional' version of the new `alpha` back-end methods
 - Would also make it easier for people in my lab to contribute to the post-processing and analysis parts of the process 
     - Keeping that stuff moving forward is critical for the success`grant-writing` and `class-teaching` parts of my life
