# 2022-09-23 - Twitch stream notes

###### tags: `freemocap` `twitch` 
Agenda:

## State of the Skelly :skull: :sparkles:    
- Approaching `v0.1.0` release:
    - GUI limping towards full functionality
    - Gonna update ReadMe on stream today
- Buggo in `v0.0.54`
    - Will fail when trying to run `mediapipe` the first time
    - fix with `pip install mediapipe --upgrade` in terminal with `freemocap-env` enabled
- Writing NSF POSE grant
    - Due Oct 21st (BIG YIKES)
    - There might be way for members of the community to help!
    - I'll try to do this as much in the open as my tender heart allows :sweat_smile: 
- I read 'Working in Public' book by Nadia Eghbal
    - Basically a anthropological study of open source projects
    - and it was awesome and hit several nails on the head 
    - maybe I'll do a reading group about it at some point
        - but not right now :joy_cat: 

## On stream plans
- Update the ReadMe with:
    -  instructions on how to run the GUI
    -  Better pointers for `pre-alpha` stuff
-  If time, record a quick session:
    -  Make a gripe sheet/ TODO list
